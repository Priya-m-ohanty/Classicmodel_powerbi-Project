# Classicmodel_powerbi-Project
Power BI dashboard analyzing Classic Models sales data, featuring KPIs, top/bottom products &amp; employees, monthly trends, product line breakdown, and global customer distribution for quick business insights.

I have created **interactive Power BI dashboard** by using the **Classic Models dataset** to analyze global sales performance. It provides insights into **sales trends, product performance, employee contributions, and geographic distribution**, helping businesses make data-driven decisions.


****ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies***
**Power BI Desktop** â€“ Data modeling, DAX measures, and visual design
**DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** â€“ Custom KPIs and calculations
**Data Cleaning & Transformation** â€“ Using Power Query for preprocessing
**Visualization Types:** KPI cards, bar charts, pie charts, line graphs, maps, Slicer, and Tooltips 

**ðŸ“Š Dashboard Insights**
Which products are driving the most revenue?
Who are our top and bottom-performing salespeople?
How do sales vary across months, product lines, and geographies?
Are high sales due to higher volumes or higher prices?

****1. Business Health at a Glance**
In the top section of my Dashboard, I have used the Card Visualization tool and the KPI tool to display Total Sales ($9.60M), Total Profit ($3.83M), and Average Sales per Product Line ($1.37M,) and Sales Trends as per Years to understand the business growth and Gap. These KPIs give decision-makers an instant sense of overall performance.


**2. Product Performance â€“ With a Twist**
Two bar charts highlight the Top 5 and Bottom 5 selling products. But instead of just showing product names as per sales, I added interactive tooltips that reveal the Quantity Ordered when hovering over a product .This feature helps to give an insight. A product might have high sales because of high prices despite low quantities. Another might sell in large volumes but still bring in lower revenue due to lower pricing. In short I used this feature to understand, along with sales, how many quantities are ordered for each product. 

**3. Understanding Product Categories**
Used pie chart to understand sales distribution by product line:
Classic Cars dominate with 40% of sales. and also added tooltips in this chart to understand each product line quantity ordered along with sales.
 
**4. Year and Country**
Used a simple slicer to filter out the insights by year and country-wise to get a good insight into which area to focus more. 

******5. Total Avg Sales as per month**
I used the new Slicer to get multiple card visualizations in one plot, where I have calculated Average Sales per month-wise to get insights as per months to understand the month-wise sales and employee performance as well. 

**6. Whoâ€™s Driving Sales (and Whoâ€™s Not)**
Employee performance charts identify top and bottom sales reps.
For underperformers, managers can dig deeper to see whether it's a territory issue, product allocation, or training need.

**7. Selling Across the Map**
An interactive map plots customers by city and country, making it easy to spot revenue hotspots and underpenetrated regions.
This geographic view supports decisions about market expansion and targeted advertising.
