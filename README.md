# Classicmodel_powerbi-Project
Power BI dashboard analyzing Classic Models sales data, featuring KPIs, top/bottom products &amp; employees, monthly trends, product line breakdown, and global customer distribution for quick business insights.
I have created **interactive Power BI dashboard** by using the **Classic Models dataset** to analyze global sales performance. It provides insights into **sales trends, product performance, employee contributions, and geographic distribution**, helping businesses make data-driven decisions.

****ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies***
**Power BI Desktop** â€“ Data modeling, DAX measures, and visual design
**DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** â€“ Custom KPIs and calculations
**Data Cleaning & Transformation** â€“ Using Power Query for preprocessing
**Visualization Types:** KPI cards, bar charts, pie charts, line graphs, maps, Slicer and Tooltips 

**ðŸ“Š Dashboard Insights**
Which products are driving the most revenue?
Who are our top and bottom-performing salespeople?
How do sales vary across months, product lines, and geographies?
Are high sales due to higher volumes or higher prices?

****1. Business Health at a Glance**
The top section of my Dashboard I have used Card Visualization tool and KPI tool to displays Total Sales ($9.60M), Total Profit ($3.83M), and Average Sales per Product Line ($1.37M) and Sales Trends as per Years to understand the business growth and Gap.These KPIs give decision-makers an instant sense of overall performance.
**2. Product Performance â€“ With a Twist**
Two bar charts highlight the Top 5 and Bottom 5 selling products.But instead of just showing productnames as per sales, I added interactive tooltips that reveal the Quantity Ordered when hovering over a product.This feature helps to give an insight, A product might have high sales because of high prices despite low quantities. Another might sell in large volumes but still bring in lower revenue due to lower pricing. In sort i used this feature to understand along with sales how many quantity get ordered in each products. 
**3. Understanding Product Categories**
Used pie chart to understand sales distribution by product line:
Classic Cars dominate with 40% of sales. and also added tooltips in this chart to understand each productline quantity ordered along with sales. 
**4. Year and Country**
Used simple slicer to filter out the insights as per years and Countrywise to get a good insight which area to focus more. 
******5. Total Avg Sales as per month**
I used new Slicer to get a multiple card visualsation in one plot, where I have calculated Average Sales per month wise to get an insights as per months to understand the month wise sales and employee performance as well. 

**6. Whoâ€™s Driving Sales (and Whoâ€™s Not)**
Employee performance charts identify top and bottom sales reps.
For underperformers, managers can dig deeper to see whether it's a territory issue, product allocation, or training need.

**7. Selling Across the Map**
An interactive map plots customers by city and country, making it easy to spot revenue hotspots and underpenetrated regions.
This geographic view supports decisions about market expansion and targeted advertising.
